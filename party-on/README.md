# Party Logic

Using React, we developed a logic puzzle game based on the app **Oh Hi**. 

## Developers
* Meryl Turner
* Joe Churchman

## Rules 
* The user is given a starter puzzle and must fill the entire grid with either red or blue squares.
* In each starter puzzle, the initial red and blue squares are locked and cannot be updated.
* There cannot be more than two consecutive squares of the same color. 
* Two adjacent lines cannot match. 
* The user must solve the puzzle to move onto the next round. 
* The user can **Start Over** or **Undo** moves during a round.
